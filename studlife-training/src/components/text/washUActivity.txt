Now, we want you to think about how you might apply the information from this module to your work as a reporter for Student Life. 


We ask that you do at least one example for the following prompt. If you’d like, you’re welcome to go through the exercise for each of the topics that is listed.


1. At the weekly news meeting, Em, one of the senior news editors, assigns you to one of the following stories. 
   1. The University is considering a plan to house all sophomores at the Village, instead of the South 40.
   2. There is not enough space in the required first-year chemistry course for all of the students who want to take the class. 
   3. A member of the Student Union executive board has been accused of running an illegal campaign in the past election.


Think about and then answer these questions (a bullet-point list for each is fine):
1. Which people on campus should I interview? (Doesn’t just have to be people mentioned in the module — you don’t have to have names, just think about the sources you would want to talk to)
2. What might be other sources of information for this story? Where might I go to look for that sort of information?
