Imagine you are taking your daily saturday walk to the farmers market and you see that the local elementary school children (and their parents) are hosting a bake sale to raise money for the school’s music program. You remember reading a news article from www.news.com about the school cutting back and defunding programs they didn’t find necessary. When you were in elementary school, your favorite part of the day was going to music class. In fact, it’s what led to your decision to be a music major in college. You walk over to the bake sale and buy a dozen cookies before perusing about the rest of the farmer’s market.


After your trip to the aforementioned farmer’s market, you went home with a lot of thoughts about what you had encountered, so much so that you felt compelled to write an article for your school newspaper. Write that “article” below in 4-7 sentences (and try to implement the information you learned in the “Writing from Experience” module).


Congratulations! You’ve finished your article and you're ready to hit the submit button. But before you do, you want to look over it and make sure that you’ve covered the basics, so that your story and argument are airtight. Write what and how you incorporated some of the elements of the “Writing from Experience” module into your “article” (i.e.Who was your target audience? What was your drive? Did you/could you include outside information into your memory? Did you learn anything new about you memory as you were writing?)
