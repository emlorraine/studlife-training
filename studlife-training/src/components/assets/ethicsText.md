**Journalism Ethics**

Student Life is an independent publication meaning that we receive no funding from any Washington University entity. This means we as a publication are not subjected to any editorial oversight from any University official. As such, we hold our journalists to a high standard of conduct to be fair, unbiased and accurate in our reporting.
 
Attached is the Code of Ethics from the Society of Professional Journalists. These principals outline the basic ethical expectations of a journalist and are the standards we strive to uphold.
