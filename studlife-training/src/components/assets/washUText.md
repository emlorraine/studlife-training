  * The University was founded in 1853
  * Roughly 7600 undergraduates and 7500 graduates
  * Made up of four undergraduate colleges:
     * Arts & Sciences
     * Olin School of Business
     * McKelvey School of Engineering
     * Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Art (Art and Architecture)
  * Graduate schools also include the School of Law, the School of Medicine, and the Brown School of Social Work 
  * The University has an endowment of more than $8 billion, though the use of most of that money is quite restricted because the donors who give the money have earmarked it for specific purposes.


* __The Washington University Administration__
  * The University is governed by its Board of Trustees, which is legally responsible for the University and is in charge of hiring the chancellor, approving final budgets, determining professor tenure, and managing the endowment, among other responsibilities.
  * The chancellor (essentially the University’s president) is responsible for all day-to-day operations. The chancellor has a seat on the Board of Trustees but is still ultimately responsible to those trustees.
  * The provost is the University’s chief academic officer, in charge of everything from teaching and curriculum to budgeting and academic facilities. 
  * The vice chancellor for student affairs oversees most non-academic aspects of the University, from Residential Life to the First Year Center and Campus Life
  * The executive vice chancellor and chief administrative officer oversees a variety of administrative facets of the University, from campus security and capital projects to human resources and communications.


* __Important Campus Departments__
  * Residential Life deals with housing-related issues
     * 74 percent of undergraduates live in University-owned and operated housing (some of which is off campus); the other 26 percent find their own off-campus housing
     * South 40: The area just South of the main part of campus where all freshmen and most sophomores live. Includes the Bear’s Den, a main undergraduate dining hall on campus
     * The other main housing area on campus is the Village, which has a variety of housing options for sophomores, juniors and seniors
  * Campus Life
     * Coordinates Greek Life: 35 percent of Wash. U. undergrads are in a fraternity or a sorority (much higher participation in sororities than fraternities, though the future of Greek life is uncertain) — many fraternities have houses on campus, whereas the sororities do not 
   
  * Washington University Police Department
    * 63-person police force, including 43 commissioned police officers
  
* __ Student Union (SU)__
* SU allocates a $3.6 million budget per year
* Executive Branch: Five positions that are voted for annually; these are the chief officers of Student Union
   * President — leads the organization, developing goals and initiatives
   * Executive Vice President — handles internal policy
   * Vice President of Finance — coordinates funding for student groups
   * Vice President of Engagement — works to better support students 
   * Vice President of Programming — organizes SU programming like Walk In Lay Down (WILD) and Gameday with the Student Union Programming Board
   * The executive branch also consists of various councils and committees, from class councils to the Social Programming Board and the Student Environmental Council
* Legislative
   * Treasury 
      * Controls the SU budget, allocating funds.
      * Divided into Activities Committee and Budget Committee
      * Led by Speaker of the Treasury
   * Senate
      * The advocacy arm of SU, with these committees: 
         * Academic Affairs, Campus & Residential Community Experience, Diversity & Inclusion, and Health & Wellness
      * Led by Speaker of the Senate
* Judicial
   * Constitutional Council, which interprets the SU Constitution and Statutes
   * Election Commission — oversees Student Union elections 


* __The University’s role in the St. Louis region__
* The Danforth Campus (where most undergraduate life takes place) is not actually located in St. Louis City, but is instead situated in St. Louis County, which is separate from the City
* Wash. U. is the region’s third largest employer, with 15,818 employees as of December 2017 (fewer only than Walmart and Barnes Jewish, the main hospital in the city)
* The Delmar Loop is a key shopping and cultural strip about a 10-minute walk from campus: many students live there (some in University housing known as The Lofts) and others go out to eat there, see movies and concerts, etc.
