Reporting 101
Find a story: 
Every story starts with something happening, or something strange being noticed. 
Whether it’s the creation of a new academic program, the university announcing plans to completely shut down another end of campus under the guise of “construction,”  if students might care about it, we should be reporting on it. 
As a reporter, you should make a mental note of anything and everything you think might be newsworthy, and bring all of those ideas to your editor. 


Research  
So now you have a story you want to tell - that’s awesome! The problem is, you more than likely know nothing about it outside of what the lede is. Before you talk to people who know all about what happened or why things are the way they are, it’s good to get a basic understanding of the subject. 


For example, if you want to write an article about a recent protest against the University’s investment in fossil fuels, it would be a good idea to figure out what exactly the protesters are angry about, what these movements have tried to do to protest in the past, and how the administration has responded. 


Besides, this newspaper has been around since 1878 - chances are we’ve written something on the subject in years past. Do a little digging, and once you feel like you have a basic grasp on what’s going on, figure out who still knows way more than you.


Reach out to sources: 


Every good news story is built, first and foremost, on information and quotes provided by sources who are knowledgeable about the subject. Sometimes it’s obvious who these sources are - if you’re writing an article on a research team discovering that zika virus can kill certain cancer cells, it’s obviously pretty important to reach out to someone on the research team that made the discovery - but sometimes it can be less obvious. 


In general, you want to talk to anyone who played a major part in making whatever event you’re reporting on happen and anyone who passionately opposes or supports its happening (and has a rationale for doing so). 


Finally, because we’re a student newspaper, getting students’ reaction to the event is often helpful as well. The contact information of anyone affiliated with the University can be found in the directory, which can be found in the top-right hand corner of the University website. You get the hang of this pretty quickly after you’ve written a few articles, but if you ever have questions about it, don’t hesitate to let us know. 


Once you’ve identified the people you want to talk to, it’s time to reach out and ask them for an interview. When you do so make it very clear that you’re a Student Life reporter requesting an interview - you never want someone thinking they’re just having a casual chat with you only to read their quotes in the paper a day later. 


The earlier you can do this the better - most people we interview are busy, and the more options we have for times to set up an interview the better. 
It’s good to give the subject a vague idea of what you want to talk to them about (ex. I would love to talk to you about your role in organizing the anti-fossil fuels protest), but our policy is that with very few exceptions we do not email subjects questions in advance of an interview. 


Interview: 
So you’ve found a knowledgeable source and set up an interview with them - great! Now it’s time to find out what they know and to get their perspective on whatever happened. 


As a general guideline, the best interviews are always the ones that feel like an authentic conversation between two interested parties. Interviewing someone is decidedly a skill, and like any other skill, it might feel awkward and disjointed at first, but with repeated practice it can start to come naturally. Until then, there’s a couple of things you can do to make your interviews go as smoothly as possible:


Before you even leave your dorm to go to the interview, you should write out a list of questions you know you definitely want to ask. The better you get at interviewing the less of these pre-written questions you’ll eventually need, but when you’re just starting out it’s a good idea to aim for seven or eight pre-written questions. You should ask two kinds of questions to everyone you interview…


The first type of question asks about the basic information of the article - you want to get the facts about the situation. As a general rule of thumb, you should ask any questions that are some variation of who, what, when, where, or how that are applicable. Even if you’ve already asked a previous source these questions, it’s always good to confirm them. 


The second type of question asks the source for their opinion, and will eventually make up most of the quotes in your article. These questions can be tricky to write, but in general you want to make sure they are open-ended and inquisitive. The person you are talking to should really care about what happened - ask them how they feel about it. 
With your questions written, it’s time to go interview. You should only take three things with you to an interview: a notebook, a pen, and something to record the interview with (voice memos on iPhones works great). 


When you first walk into an interview you should always do a couple of things: 


Thank the subject for taking the time to talk. They’re busy and good connections with sources are important for all kinds of reasons. 


Always ask for the basic information about the subject, such as their name, position/title, and preferred pronouns first.


ASK TO RECORD Conducting interviews: Interviews must be recorded so that we can accurately quote sources, and it’s ethical to let the subject know they’re being recorded. The only reason not to record someone is if they specifically ask for the interview to be “off the record,” meaning that nothing they say can be quoted or paraphrased in the article, or “on background,” meaning that their insights can be paraphrased, but none of their quotes can be used. 


Subjects might also ask you if they can be quoted anonymously, and if identifying them might harm them in some way we can consider this option. However, in general it is always best to get on the record, named sources. It’s also important to clarify with sources that ask for their interviews to be off the record, on background or anonymous what they think those terms mean. Often subjects have little to no background in journalism and might think on background means nothing can be used or that off the record means we can paraphrase, so if they insist on not being quoted or being quoted anonymously, make sure you both know exactly what that means. Once you’ve done these things, hit record (again, all interviews must be recorded) and ask your first question.
During the interview, always keep in mind that you want to make the subject feel like they’re discussing their interests with a friend. Often, they might be guarded about what they want to say, or nervous, or both. Your job is to put them at ease so they can tell you honestly and effectively what they know and what they think. In general, this means being attentive. 


Asking follow up questions is important. If you listen closely enough, almost any interviewee will say something during the course of a conversation that deserves further investigation. Whether they simply need to be asked “why do you think that?” or whether something they say leads you to another question entirely, be flexible in interviews and clarify anything you can


When both your written and follow up questions have been exhausted, you always want to end the interview with two specific questions: 
 “Who else should I be speaking to about this?” Sources very often know who was involved in an event better than you as a reporter ever could, and asking this simple question will help point you towards people you might otherwise have missed. 
“Do you have any final thoughts?” Sources also know if there is something important you haven’t asked about, and you’d be shocked at how remembering to ask this question right at the end can reveal some fantastic quotes and information. With these two questions asked (assuming no further follow up questions come up), the interview is over. Thank the interviewee for their time again and that’s it! You’ve got all the information you need for your article. 


Transcribe - After the interview, your next step is to transcribe. Listen to the recording of your interview and type up a transcription of your interview - this is a word for word written record of what was said. Although not every single thing needs to be transcribed - don’t write down verbal tics like “ummm” and “like,” and if something very obviously won’t be used in the article don’t feel obligated to transcribe it - but in general the more written down the better. Once you are done transcribing, comb over the entire interview and highlight the quotes that you believe would be most useful to you in the process of writing the article. This cuts down your time in hunting for quotes to include in the article later on.


Occasionally, sources will ask to see articles before we publish them. Our policy on this is that we do not under any circumstances share our articles before they are published.
