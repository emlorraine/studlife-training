WashU Overview and Power Structures Module


Where am I? — The basics about how the University is structured
* Wash. U. has been around since 1853
* Roughly 7600 undergraduates and 7500 graduates
* Made up of four undergraduate colleges
   * Arts & Sciences
   * Olin School of Business
   * McKelvey School of Engineering
   * Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Art (Art and Architecture)
* Graduate schools also include the School of Law, the School of Medicine, and the Brown School of Social Work 
* The University has an endowment of more than $8 billion, though the use of most of that money is quite restricted because the donors who give the money have earmarked it for specific purposes


Who runs this place? — The WashU Administration
* Wash. U. is governed by its Board of Trustees, which is legally responsible for the University and is in charge of hiring the chancellor, approving final budgets, determining professor tenure, and managing the endowment, among other responsibilities
* The chancellor (basically the University’s CEO or president) is responsible for all day-to-day operations. The chancellor has a seat on the Board of Trustees but is still ultimately responsible to those trustees at the end of the day.
* The provost is the University’s chief academic officer, in charge of everything from teaching and curriculum to budgeting and academic facilities. 
* The vice chancellor for student affairs oversees most non-academic aspects of the University, from Residential Life to the First Year Center and Campus Life
* The executive vice chancellor and chief administrative officer oversees a variety of administrative facets of the University, from campus security and capital projects to human resources and communications


Who actually does the day-to-day work? — Important Campus Departments
* Residential Life deals with housing-related issues
   * 74 percent of undergraduates (and essentially all freshmen and sophomores) live in WashU-owned and operated housing (some of which is off campus); the other 26 percent find their own off-campus housing
   * South 40: The area just South of the main part of campus where all freshmen and most sophomores live. Includes the Bear’s Den, a main undergraduate dining hall on campus
   * The other main housing area on campus is the Village, which has a variety of housing options for sophomores, juniors and seniors
* Campus Life
   * Coordinates Greek Life: 35 percent of Wash. U. undergrads are in a fraternity or a sorority (much higher participation in sororities than fraternities, though the future of Greek life is uncertain) — many fraternities have houses on campus, whereas the sororities do not 
   * Director of Campus Life Leslie Heusted
* Washington University Police Department
   * 63-person police force, including 43 commissioned police officers
   * Tenuous relationship with the student body, particularly students of color
   * Chief Mark Glenn


What about the students? — Student Union (SU)

What’s beyond campus? — Wash. U.’s place in the St. Louis region
* The Danforth Campus (where most undergraduate life takes place) is not actually located in St. Louis City, but is instead situated in St. Louis County, which is separate from the City
* Wash. U. is the region’s third largest employer, with 15,818 employees as of December 2017 (fewer only than Walmart and Barnes Jewish, the main hospital in the city)
* The Delmar Loop is a key shopping and cultural strip about a 10-minute walk from campus: many students live there (some in University housing known as The Lofts) and others go out to eat there, see movies and concerts, etc.
