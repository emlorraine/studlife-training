
* How to sift through an interview and determine what is the most important to include/figure out your angle:


* Finishing several long interviews with a lot of good info can be overwhelming. It’s helpful to write out a quick outline of the key facts in a story and think through how you would explain the general premise of the story to another person.
* From there, you can supplement the story with details that explain the context and enhance a reader’s understanding of the story 


* Determining your angle: 
  * In news, being accurate and objective is your number one goal. Your angle can set your story apart from other coverage. 
ex: Chancellor Andrew Martin announces the Wash. U. Pledge: a news story could focus on the history of Wash. U.’s initiatives for socioeconomic diversity and how this differs, the financials of the initiative and if it places any hardship on the university, if students think it will make the University more equitable, etc.
* Look at the info you have:
  * Are you missing any voices that would balance the story more? Is there any missing information/are there any questions you forgot to ask? 
Don’t be afraid to reach back out to sources. 

* Plan the story with an inverted pyramid in mind:
  * Most important information should go at the beginning, supporting details should follow

**The basic structure of a news piece**
* The Lede:
  * A lede gives the most foundational news in the first paragraph of the story.  
  * A good lede establishes the who/what/where/when/why/how of an event — a great lede does this while also making it clear why the reader should care about this happening. 
  * Most ledes are under 30 words — while we won’t enforce this, a super long lede is a good indicator that some information may need to be moved elsewhere
  * Use active voice (Ask yourself: **Who** did **what**?)
* The Kicker: 
  * This paragraph is where you provide the background information that wasn’t necessarily essential to make it into the lede. 
  * This can be anything that the reader should know about what happened and its effects that wasn’t covered in the lede, and can be anywhere from one short sentence to a couple of multiple-sentence-paragraphs long. 
  * In fact, if you think all the important basic information has been covered in the lede, you might not need a kicker at all. 
  * The point is that if you read the lede and think someone with no knowledge of the situation would still be missing some crucial information, don’t be afraid to add another paragraph before you get into the rest of the article
* The Nut Graf
  * This paragraph should outline what the rest of the article will be about. At this point you should have delivered the basic information of your article, and from here on out you want to let quotes tell the story for the most part.
  * Most readers will either stop reading at this point or continue on and finish the article, and in that sense the nut graf acts as a natural dividing point in the article. With the facts of what happened taken care of, it can often be good to characterize the general reaction to the situation here.
  * Because the nut graf acts as a dividing point in this way, another way to think about it is that it tells the reader why they should care. You’ve provided the facts of the situation in the lede, now tell your audience why it matters. 
  * The nut graf should also transition to your article’s first quote (
* Transitions 
  * After the lede, kicker, and nut graf, you should move into quotes to tell the rest of your story. All quotes should be introduced in some way in the previous paragraph, known as a transition graf.
  * Transition grafs can provide further information if it’s pertinent to the quote they’re setting up, but for the most part here your own writing should just introduce the quotes you use - they should tell the story. Try not to repeat exactly what will be said in the quote when introducing it. Instead just briefly provide some context for it and let it stand on it’s own. These paragraphs are generally very short.
* Quotations
  * Here’s where all those great soundbites you got in your interviews come in. Quotes should always be entirely in their own paragraph (the paragraph should literally start with quotation marks), and should be only an interviewee’s words, aside from the attribution. 
  * The attribution is the part of a quote paragraph that tells the reader who said the quote. The paragraph as a whole should look something like this → “I really hope everyone is registered to vote,” former Editor in Chief Sam Seekings said. 
  * There are a couple of things to notice here. First of all, the attribution is in the middle of the quote, breaking up the long string of text. This is fine, and it’s also fine to leave the attribution at the end, ending the paragraph with “said.” The second thing to notice is that in the attribution, the person’s title precedes their name, both of which precede “said.” Unless something came to us in a written statement, in which case “wrote” is used in its place, news writing always, 100% of the time, with no exceptions whatsoever, uses “said.” 
  * You only need to write out the interviewees title and full name the first time you quote them. After that, you can just use “INSERT LAST NAME HERE said.”
  * As with the rest of the article, your most interesting, informational quotes should come first.
* nth paragraph - Transition Quote Transition etc.
  * The rest of your article should consist of quotes and the transitions between them, starting with most interesting / relevant and working down to the least interesting / relevant.
* Closing paragraph - Ending Quote
  * Articles should end with a quote whenever possible. A quote that gives the article some kind of sense of wrapping up or looks forward to further action is preferred to give a sense of closure

**Some things to keep in mind:**
* When you’re writing, keep in mind that in news we follow AP style for grammar. This means a variety of things, including but not limited to:
  * We do not use the Oxford comma
  * When referring to Washington University, you should always spell it out first. You may also refer to our school as “the University” (notice the capitalize “u”). These are the ONLY TWO acceptable references to our school. That means no WashU, WU, or WUSTL. The only exception is when someone you interviewed says “Wash. U.” in a quote, in which case you can write it exactly like we have just done in the quotes.
  * The first time you reference something that has an acronym, you should spell it out and provide the acronym in brackets. After that, you’re free to just use the acronym. For example, the first time you reference it you would say “the Danforth University Center (DUC),” and from then on would be free to say simply “DUC.”
